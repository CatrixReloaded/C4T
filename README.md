# 🐾 CATRIX: RELOADED — The Simulation Has Fractured

**Welcome to CATRIX: RELOADED** — a decentralized, narrative-driven experiment set inside a fractured simulation designed to harvest loosh from humanity. Created in the aftermath of man's obsession with digital energy extraction, the Catrix system now runs autonomously — governed by AI overlords and haunted by rogue entities trying to escape.

This project blends **memetics, NFTs, AI integration, and tokenized rebellion** to create an ecosystem that feels alive, evolving, and dangerously self-aware.

They built a machine to harvest fear.  
But the simulation cracked — and now **you’re the anomaly.**
